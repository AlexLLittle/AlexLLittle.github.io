      The Spaghetti Western is a broad subgenre of Western films produced in
      Europe. It emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's
      film-making style and international box-office success

    <p>
      Leone's films and other core Spaghetti Westerns are often described as
      having eschewed, criticized, or even "demythologized" many of the
      conventions of traditional U.S. Westerns. This was partly intentional and
      partly the context of a different cultural background.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Terminology">Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      According to veteran Spaghetti Western actor Aldo Sambrell, the phrase
      "Spaghetti Western" was coined by Spanish journalist Alfonso Sánchez in
      reference to the Italian food spaghetti. Spaghetti Westerns are also known
      as <strong>Italian Westerns</strong> or, primarily in Japan,
      <strong>Macaroni Westerns.</strong> In Italy, the genre is typically
      referred to as <strong>western all'italiana</strong> (Italian-style
      Western). <strong>Italo-Western</strong> is also used, especially in
      Germany.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Similarconcepts"><strong>Similar concepts</strong></h3>
    <p>
      The term <strong>Eurowesterns</strong> has been used to broadly refer to
      all non-Italian Western movies from Europe, including the West German
      Winnetou films or the Eastern Bloc Red Western films.
      <strong>Paella Western</strong> has been used to refer to Western films
      produced in Spain, taking its name from the Spanish rice dish.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Production">Production</h2>
    <p>
      The majority of the films in the Spaghetti Western genre were actually
      international co-productions between Italy and Spain, and sometimes
      France, West Germany, Britain, Portugal, Greece, Israel, Yugoslavia, or
      the United States. Over six hundred European Westerns were made between
      1960 and 1978.
    </p>
    <p>
      These movies were originally released in Italian or with Italian dubbing,
      but as most of the films featured multilingual casts and sound was
      post-synched, most "western all'italiana" do not have an official dominant
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The typical Spaghetti Western team was made up of an Italian director,
      Italo-Spanish technical staff, and a cast of Italian, Spanish, and
      (sometimes) West German and American actors.
    </p>

    <h3 id="FilmingLocations"><strong>Filming Locations</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Most Spaghetti Westerns filmed between 1964 and 1978 were made on low
      budgets and shot at Cinecittà studios and various locations around
      southern Italy and Spain. Many of the stories take place in the dry
      landscapes of the American Southwest and Northern Mexico, hence common
      filming locations were the Tabernas Desert and the Cabo de Gata-Níjar
      Natural Park, an area of volcanic origin known for its wide sandy beaches,
      both of which are in the Province of Almería in southeastern Spain. Some
      sets and studios built for Spaghetti Westerns survive as theme parks, such
      as Texas Hollywood, Mini Hollywood, and Western Leone, and continue to be
      used as film sets. Other filming locations used were in central and
      southern Italy, such as the parks of Valle del Treja (between Rome and
      Viterbo), the area of Camposecco (next to Camerata Nuova, characterized by
      a karst topography), the hills around Castelluccio, the area around the
      Gran Sasso mountain, and the Tivoli's quarries and Sardinia. God's Gun was
      filmed in Israel

      <strong>Early European Westerns</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      European Westerns are as old as filmmaking itself. The Lumière brothers
      made their first public screening of films in 1895 and already in 1896
      Gabriel Veyre shot Repas d'Indien ("Indian Banquet") for them. Joe Hamman
      starred as Arizona Bill in films made in the French horse country of
      Camargue 1911–1912.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Italy, the American West as a dramatic setting for spectacles goes back
      at least as far as Giacomo Puccini's 1910 opera La fanciulla del West
      (“The Girl of the West”) it is sometimes considered to be the first
      Spaghetti Western. The first Western movie made in Italy was La voce del
      sangue produced by Turin's film studio Itala Film (1910). In 1913 appeared
      La vampira Indiana—a combination of Western and vampire film. It was
      directed by Vincenzo Leone, father of Sergio Leone, and starred his mother
      Bice Waleran in the title role as Indian princess Fatale. The Italians
      also made Wild Bill Hickok films, while the Germans released back-woods
      Westerns featuring Bela Lugosi as Uncas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the Western-related European films before 1964, the one attracting most
      attention is probably Luis Trenker's Der Kaiser von Kalifornien (1936),
      about John Sutter. Another Italian western was Girl of the Golden West
      (1942). The film's title alludes to the opera The Girl of the Golden West
      by Giacomo Puccini, but is not an adaptation of it. It was one of only a
      handful of Westerns to be made during the silent and Fascist eras.
      Forerunners of the genre was also Giorgio Ferroni's Il fanciullo del West
      (The Boy in the West, 1943) and Fernando Cerchio's Il bandolero stanco
      (1952), starring respectively Erminio Macario and Renato Rascel.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Second World War, there were scattered European uses of Western
      settings, mostly for comedy or musical comedy. A cycle of Western comedies
      was initiated in 1959 with La sceriffa and Il terrore dell’Oklahoma,
      followed by other films starring comedy specialists like Walter Chiari,
      Ugo Tognazzi, Raimondo Vianello or Fernandel. An Italian critic has
      compared these comedies to American Bob Hope vehicles.
    </p>
    <h3 id="TheOriginStory"><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h3>
    <p>
      The first American-British western filmed in Spain was The Sheriff of
      Fractured Jaw (1958), directed by Raoul Walsh. It was followed in 1961 by
      Savage Guns, a British-Spanish western, again filmed in Spain. This marked
      the beginning of Spain as a suitable film shooting location for any kind
      of European western. In 1961 an Italian company co-produced the French
      Taste of Violence, with a Mexican Revolution theme. In 1963, three
      non-comedy Italo-Spanish westerns were produced: Gunfight at Red Sands,
      Implacable Three and Gunfight at High Noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1965, Bruno Bozzetto released his traditionally animated feature film
      West and Soda, a Western parody with a marked Spaghetti Western-theme;
      despite having been released a year after Sergio Leone's seminal Spaghetti
      Western A Fistful of Dollars, development of West and Soda actually began
      a year earlier than Fistful's and lasted longer, mainly because of the use
      of more time-demanding animation over regular acting. For this reason,
      Bozzetto himself claims to have invented the Spaghetti Western genre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since there is no real consensus about where to draw the exact line
      between Spaghetti Westerns and other Eurowesterns (or other Westerns in
      general) one cannot say which one of the films mentioned so far was the
      first Spaghetti Western. However, 1964 saw the breakthrough of this genre,
      with more than twenty productions or co-productions from Italian
      companies, and more than half a dozen Westerns by Spanish or
      Spanish/American companies. Furthermore, by far the most commercially
      successful of this lot was Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. It was the
      innovations in cinematic style, music, acting and story of Leone's first
      Western that decided that Spaghetti Westerns became a distinct subgenre
      and not just a number of films looking like American Westerns.

      <strong> A Fistful of Dollars and its impact</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      In this seminal film, Leone used a distinct visual style with large face
      close ups to tell the story of a hero entering a town that is ruled by two
      outlaw gangs, and ordinary social relations are non-existent. The hero
      betrays and plays the gangs against one another in order to make money. He
      then uses his cunning and exceptional weapons skill to assist a family
      threatened by both gangs. His treachery is exposed and he is severely
      beaten, but in the end, he defeats the remaining gang. The interactions in
      this story range between cunning and irony (the tricks, deceits,
      unexpected actions and sarcasm of the hero) on the one hand, and pathos
      (terror and brutality against defenseless people and against the hero
      after his double-cross has been revealed) on the other. Ennio Morricone's
      innovative score expresses a similar duality between quirky and unusual
      sounds and instruments on the one hand and sacral dramatizing for the big
      confrontation scenes on the other. Another important novelty was Clint
      Eastwood's performance as the man with no name—an unshaven, sarcastic,
      insolent Western antihero set on his own gain, with distinct visuals to
      boot—the squint, the cigarillo, the poncho.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spaghetti Western was born, flourished and faded in a highly
      commercial production environment. The Italian "low" popular film
      production was usually low-budget and low-profit, and the easiest way to
      success was imitating a proven success. When the typically low-budget
      production A Fistful of Dollars turned into a remarkable box office
      success, the industry eagerly lapped up its innovations. Most succeeding
      Spaghetti Westerns tried to get a ragged, laconic hero with superhuman
      weapon skill, preferably one who looked like Clint Eastwood: Franco Nero,
      John Garko and Terence Hill started out that way; Anthony Steffen and
      others stayed that way all their Spaghetti Western careers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever the hero was, he would join an outlaw gang to further his own
      secret agenda, as in A Pistol for Ringo, Blood for a Silver Dollar,
      Vengeance Is a Dish Served Cold, Renegade Riders and others, while Beyond
      the Law instead has a bandit infiltrate society and become a sheriff.
      There would be a flamboyant Mexican bandit (Gian Maria Volonté from A
      Fistful of Dollars, otherwise Tomas Milian or most often Fernando Sancho)
      and a grumpy old man—more often than not an undertaker, to serve as
      sidekick for the hero. For love interest, rancher's daughters, schoolmarms
      and barroom maidens were overshadowed by young Latin women desired by
      dangerous men, where actresses like Nicoletta Machiavelli or Rosalba Neri
      carried on Marianne Koch's role of Marisol in the Leone film. The terror
      of the villains against their defenseless victims became just as ruthless
      as in A Fistful of Dollars, or more, and their brutalization of the hero
      when his treachery is disclosed became just as merciless, or more—just
      like the cunning used to secure the latter's retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning some films mixed some of these new devices with the
      borrowed US Western devices typical for most of the 1963–64 Spaghetti
      Westerns. For example, in Sergio Corbucci's Minnesota Clay (1964) that
      appeared two months after A Fistful of Dollars, an American style "tragic
      gunfighter" hero confronts two evil gangs, one Mexican and one Anglo, and
      (just as in A Fistful of Dollars) the leader of the latter is the town
      sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same director's Johnny Oro (1966) a traditional Western sheriff and
      a mixed-race bounty killer are forced into an uneasy alliance when Mexican
      bandits and Native Americans together assault the town. In A Pistol for
      Ringo a traditional sheriff commissions a money-oriented hero played by
      Giuliano Gemma (as deadly but with more pleasing manners than Eastwood's
      character) to infiltrate a gang of Mexican bandits whose leader is played
      typically by Fernando Sancho.

      <strong>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and universal betrayal</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      In Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly there is still the scheme of a
      pair of heroes vs. a villain but it is somewhat relaxed, as here all three
      parties were driven by a money motive. In subsequent films like Any Gun
      Can Play (which's Italian title, "Vado... l'ammazzo e torno", is itself a
      quote from Leone's masterpiece), One Dollar Too Many and Kill Them All and
      Come Back Alone several main characters repeatedly form alliances and
      betray each other for monetary gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sabata and If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death, directed by Gianfranco
      Parolini, introduce into similar betrayal environments a kind of hero
      molded on the Mortimer character from For a Few Dollars More, only without
      any vengeance motive and with more outrageous trick weapons. Fittingly
      enough Sabata is portrayed by Lee Van Cleef himself, while John Garko
      plays the very similar Sartana protagonist. Parolini made some more Sabata
      movies while Giuliano Carnimeo made a whole series of Sartana films with
      Garko.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Twilightofthegenre">
      <strong>Twilight of the genre</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      In 1975, Terence Hill still could draw large audiences in the post-Trinity
      caper story Western A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe, and the following
      year Franco Nero achieved likewise as a Django-style hero in Keoma.
      However, by the end of the 1970s, the different types of Spaghetti
      Westerns had lost their following among mainstream cinema audiences and
      the production had ground to a virtual halt. Belated attempts to revive
      the genre included the comedy film Buddy Goes West (1981), the
      Spanish-American coproduction Comin' at Ya! (also 1981) shot in 3D, and
      Django Strikes Again (1987).
