        The two travelers embark on a journey in a carriage. The journey is
        filled with joy from the people they are traveling with, but it is long.
        Very long in fact. As the days grow shorter Charley just wishes that the
        TARDIS landed in Singapore like it was supposed to. Even the Doctor got
        so sick of the ride he started sleeping at night. While this trip is
        barely longer than the boat trip would have taken, this trip is not
        relaxing. At least the food is freshly hunted and cooked every night.
