        The Doctor rushes to the doors of that TARDIS and pushes them open he
        begins to say, “Doctor who ever you are you need to leave because there
        is already-” before he finishes his thought, he sees a future
        incarnation of himself pushing Davros, creator of the Daleks towards the
        doors. Standing by the console is Sarah Jane Smith, a former companion
        of the Doctor that traveled with the 3rd and 4th incarnations, not the
        one she is currently with.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I was hoping that the TARDIS locked on to a more proactive self than
        you” the future doctor said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Watch it chiny” the 8th doctor retorted towards the mysterious
        incarnation, “what do you mean? You had the TARDIS locked on yourself?
        You thought it would be a good idea to send Davros to another one of
        you?
      </p>
      <p>
        “Doctor what is going on?” Charley now entered the TARDIS to join the
        fun,
      </p>
      <p>
        “Not only am I being abused by one of you Doctor, now there are two of
        you”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Shut up Davros, I’m not done finding out why chiny is here, why are you
        here?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It's complicated, well I guess it is always complicated. I accidentally
        landed on Skaro during the time war and -”
      </p>
      <p>“The time war?”</p>
      <p>
        “Oh you aren’t there yet. Well it doesn’t matter I shouldn’t have been
        able to land there but I did. Sarah and I managed to trick Davros and if
        we get him as far away from the war as possible WE might be able to
        prevent the deaths of millions of Timelords”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hold on, you tricked Davros, and are traveling with Sarah Jane Smith
        again?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hello Doctor, I see you’ve regenerated again” Sarah said, revealing her
        presence to the 8th Doctor”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I see it has been quite some time since we have traveled, it is good to
        see you aboard the TARDIS yet again, although what have you done to this
        place chiny?”
      </p>
      <p>“Oy watch it -”</p>
      <p>
        “Can we please end this idle chatter?” Davros says, now in control of
        his chair leaving the TARDIS.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Charley, why didn’t you stop him from leaving?” The 8th Doctor said.
      </p>
      <p>“I really don’t know what is going on, was I supposed to stop him?”</p>
      <p>
        “Yes!” both Doctors said! Everyone left the TARDIS but Davros barely
        insight.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Great” the 8th Doctor started, “now we have let Davros loose in
        revolutionary America”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Revolutionary America is that where we are?” the other Doctor said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Doctors, I don’t mean to interrupt, but what are we going to do about
        Davros? We can’t just let him loose!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Correct you are Sarah” the 8th Doctor said, but this isn’t my fight.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Actually I brought my TARDIS here just so that two of us can be
        fighting Davros, to truly defeat him"
      </p>
