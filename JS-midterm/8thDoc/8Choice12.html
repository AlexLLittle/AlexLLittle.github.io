        The Doctor and Charley wait out front until they see Davros, the creator
        of the Daleks fly out of the TARDIS
      </p>
      <p>“What the-” The 8th Doctor says running towards Davros</p>
      <p>
        “Not another one of you!” Davros says before a future incarnation of the
        Doctor rushes out of the TARDIS to grab Davro’s chair. Following behind
        him is Sarah Jane Smith.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I was hoping that the TARDIS locked on to a more proactive self than
        you” the future doctor said, “anyways you know-”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Why if it isn’t Sarah Jane Smith. I can tell it's been a while since
        the last time I saw you, what are you doing traveling with chiny and
        what is going on?”
      </p>
      <p>“Actually I can explain-”</p>
      <p>“Shut up chiny. I trust Sarah to explain much better than you”</p>
      <p>
        “Well, we accidentally landed on Skaro, and after a bit the Doctor
        decided to try and trick Davros onto the TARDIS taking him as far away
        from the time war as possible to save millions of lives”
      </p>
      <p>“The time war?”</p>
      <p>
        “You haven’t gotten there yet” the other Doctor interjected, “you will
        soon if we don’t end Davros here and now” Davros begins to squirm around
        in the chair until he gets his hands on the control and spins it, taking
        both Doctors by surprise and starts flying off into town”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Great” the 8th Doctor started, “now we have let Davros loose in
        revolutionary America”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well what are we going to do Doctor? I’m rather confused on what's
        going on” Charley finally said after standing there watching.
      </p>
      <p>“Well Charley, this isn’t our fight. It is chin’s fight”</p>
      <p>
        “I brought my TARDIS here just so that two of us can be fighting Davros,
        to truly defeat him”
