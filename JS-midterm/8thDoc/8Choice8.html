         “So Doctor, why won’t we have time for both?” Charley asked as the pair were walking.  
    </p>
<p>
	“Time is a fragile thing Charley, if we stay here too long, the chances of disturbances to the timeline increases. Both the Congress and Thomas Paine will be in Pennsylvania, but we should leave after seeing one of them, to lower the odds of us causing issues.”
</p>
     <p>
      “So which one are we seeing?”  
     </p>
	<p>
        “As much as I would like to meet Thomas Paine, if we attend a session of the Second Continental Congress, not only do we have a chance to meet him, but other figures that were key to the American revolution!”
    </p>
    <p>
“Great. I suppose once we get there all we do is watch?”
    </p>
	<p>
        “Yes Charley. While it isn’t perfect, America is important to Earth’s history for thousands of years. If we prevent it from existing the consequences could be dire. You could cease to exist.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “I’ve already died, how bad could not existing be? Anyways Doctor, how are we getting to Pennsylvania Doctor? Why not take the TARDIS?”
 </p>
   <p>
	“If we take the TARDIS there is a high chance that we will miss our destination completely. We will have to take either a boat or carriage.”
   </p>
<p>
“But those could take weeks!”    
</p>
	<p>
        “Only about one week Charley, but that is why once we attend congress we will begin the trek back to the TARDIS, now let us make a choice”
