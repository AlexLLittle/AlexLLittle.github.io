        "There Charley, we have landed", the Doctor said taking his hands off of
        the TARDIS console,
      </p>
      <p>"It better be Singapore 1930"</p>
      <p>
        "I've told you Charley, I don't intentionally go off course. I know you
        need to meet your friend", the pair open the doors of the TARDIS finding
        themselves out in the daylight on an old-fashioned pier. "Look Charley",
        the Doctor Started, "We landed by the coast! This may actually be
        Singapore", Charley looked around a bit before saying,
      </p>
      <p>
        "No cars, no street lamps, no nothing Doctor! Even if this is Singapore,
        it isn't 1930!", the Doctor stands there and takes in a huge breath,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, it appears you may be right Charlie. The air smells of the western
        hemisphere. Based on the basic surroundings I'd wager we have landed in
        the new world.",
      </p>
      <p>"So not Singapore, lets just go Doctor!",</p>
      <p>
        "Why the rush Charley? I'd quite like to figure out where we are, who
        knows maybe there will be something for my to cross off my bucket list",
      </p>
      <p>"Your bucket list?",</p>
      <p>
        "Yes yes, my bucket list Charley, I'm a time traveler not a monster you
        know"
      </p>

      <p><strong>How should the Doctor find out where they are?</strong></p>
