        “Well Charley” the Doctor started to say while opening the door to the
        TARDIS, “I’m sorry that there wasn’t much for you to do here”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It's okay Doctor, let's just make sure we get to Singapore 1930 next!”
      </p>
      <p>“That all depends on our luck Charley”</p>
      <p>“I thought you weren’t a big believer in luck Doctor”</p>
      <p>
        “I never said that Charley, or never meant it like that. Luck is just a
        very human concept”
      </p>
      <p>“Is it really?”</p>
      <p>“No. Not really, Singapore, here we come!”</p>
