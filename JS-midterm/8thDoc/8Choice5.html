        “Well Charley, we have finally made it!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “About time, the sooner you meet Thomas Paine, the sooner we get to eat
        proper meals again…”
      </p>
      <p>
        “If my history is correct, and it usually is, we have just barely missed
        a continental congress, but that means Thomas Paine should be leaving
        soon”
      </p>
      <p>“Do you even know what he looks like?”</p>
      <p>
        “Of course I do! He is one of the most influential writers of this time.
        Maybe of all time or even all of Earth! I know what Thomas Paine looks
        like!” A man approaches from behind and stands there, Charley nods
        towards him and the Doctor turns to face him, “Oh hello sir, who might
        you be?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I am Thomas Paine. Now I might inquirer as to who you are” once more
        Charley starts to chuckle before saying,
      </p>
      <p>“I thought you knew what he looked like?”</p>
      <p>
        “I’ve only seen paintings, Charley. He looks very different in person”
      </p>
      <p>“He is standing right there”</p>
      <p>“The lady is right. Who are you?”</p>
      <p>
        “I am the Doctor, and this is my traveling companion Charley Pollard”
      </p>
      <p>“What do you want with me Mr. Doctor?”</p>
      <p>“Just Doctor is fine and well I am a big fan really”</p>
      <p>
        “Doctor…” Charley interrupts to prevent the Doctor from making a
        complete fool of himself.
      </p>
      <p>“What I mean Mr. Paine, uh Thomas if I may-”</p>
      <p>“You may not. Lets stick with formalities please Doctor”</p>
      <p>
        “Uh, right, Mr. Paine. What I meant to say before I got carried away is
        that I know of your wonderful writing and its great influence on what
        will become the American people and of this revolution you all have
        going on right now, and I have so much that I would love to ask you!”
        Charley leans over to the Doctor and quietly says,
      </p>
      <p>“Very cool Doctor…” in a sarcastic tone.</p>
      <p>“What was that Miss Pollard?”</p>
      <p>“Nothing Mr. Paine”</p>
      <p>
        “So what do you think Mr. Paine, do you have time in your busy day to
        exchange a few words with a humble traveler like myself?”
      </p>
      <p>“Sure but let's make it quick I have work that needs to be done”</p>
