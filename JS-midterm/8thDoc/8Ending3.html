        “Ok chiny, Charley and I will head to the right to track down Davros,
        you and Sarah head to the left. We want to corner him by the Liberty
        Bell -”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, that is because the frequency of the bell will most likely be
        perfect for disabling his chair, trapping him there!”
      </p>
      <p>“Will that actually work Doctor?” Charley asked,</p>
      <p>“Yes Charley, it will” the 8th Doctor said back to her,</p>
      <p>
        “It seems awfully simple Doctors, after all that I’ve seen Davros do,
        can a bell really stop him?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I know it sounds stupid” the future incarnation began to say, “but
        trust us Sarah. I know first hand you have seen the pain that Davros has
        caused and there is no way I will let him get away with it any longer,
        do you agree Doctor?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I do. Everytime I think I have defeated Davros for good, I always see
        him again, but no more. If this time war you speak of is the one from
        the prophecies I cannot let it happen”
      </p>
      <p>“The end of the Timelords”</p>
      <p>“I won’t let it happen”</p>
      <p>“Good”</p>
      <p>
        “We should probably go!” Charley said tugging on the 8th Doctors jacket,
        “I hear screaming in town!” The two groups split off. Eventually the 8th
        Doctor found Davros and started chasing him for a bit until they got to
        the liberty bell, unfortunately the other Doctor and Sarah were not
        there yet so the Doctor needed to distract him,
      </p>
      <p>“Wait Davros, stop running for a second!”</p>
      <p>“Why would I do that, Doctor? It is obviously a trap”</p>
      <p>
        “I always love our conversations, what shall we talk about this time? I
        distinctly remember rice pudding from our last chat”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Your timeline is so linear then. This face that you wear is not new to
        me. I have seen your next face as well”
      </p>
      <p>“Oh have you now, what is it like?”</p>
      <p>
        “He is a warrior, you will struggle to even call yourself the Doctor”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh do go on, I won’t remember most of this anyways due to the presence
        of my future self, tell me all about this time war”
      </p>
      <p>“Your people will all die”</p>
      <p>“I doubt that”</p>
      <p>
        “It's true” the future incarnation says, arriving with Sarah Jane, “to
        end the war, there was only one way”
      </p>
      <p>“What are you saying” the 8th Doctor asks</p>
      <p>“I… We end it all. Timelord and Daleks”</p>
      <p>
        “No, that isn’t-” Davros begins to let out a disgusting chuckle, a
        mechanical sound akin to a cars engine, as the 8th Doctor begins to open
        his mouth to respond the future incarnation rings the bell causing
        Davros to shake in silence,
      </p>
      <p>“Doctor, what is that in the sky?” Chaley asks looking right up,</p>
      <p>
        “The Daleks are here for him” Sarah says as Davros is transmitted about
        the ship.
      </p>
      <p>“We failed” the two Doctors said looking at each other</p>
      <p>“What will happen to America?”</p>
      <p>“Nothing will Sarah” the future incarnation says.</p>
      <p>
        “Chiny is right, the Daleks have no use for an uncivilized planet right
        now, they only need their chief. If Davros ordered invasion, they would
        do it, but he wont.” The two Doctors decide their is nothing more to do
        and they head back to the future incarnations TARDIS,
      </p>
      <p>“Need a lift to your TARDIS?”</p>
      <p>“That would be great chiny, really hate the redecoration in here”</p>
      <p>“Oy, shut it, I’m the one giving you a lift”</p>
      <p>“Your TARDIS is nicer Doctor”</p>
      <p>
        “I know Charley” The 8th Doctor walks towards Sarah, “How long has it
        been for you”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ages Doctor, ages, but I did get you a few times before getting back on
        the TARDIS”
      </p>
      <p>“You didn’t get back on right away?”</p>
      <p>
        “I couldn’t, this isn’t all that is in my life now, after offering a few
        times though I decided to take up the Doctors offer of traveling again.
        Hopefully your future self will drop me off in the right place this
        time!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Sorry to break up the reunion,” the future incarnation said, “but we
        are here in Boston”
      </p>
      <p>“Thanks for the lift chiny!”</p>
      <p>
        “Get out” the future incarnation shoved the 8th Doctor and Charley out
        and they were right in front of their TARDIS now, as they looked around
        a bit they noticed that the surroundings had changed quite a bit
        including a paved road and parked cars”
      </p>
      <p>“Even in the future you still stick at flying the TARDIS”</p>
      <p>“I guess I do Charley”</p>
      <p>“So what was all that time war stuff Doctor?”</p>
      <p>
        “Best not to worry about that, Charley, that far in my future, at least
        I hope. For now let's worry about getting you to your friend in
        Singapore.
