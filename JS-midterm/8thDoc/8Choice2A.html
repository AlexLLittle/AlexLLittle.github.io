        "Ok Charley, I think we should find a newspaper, that would be the
        easiest way to find out where we are without causing a possible
        disturbance"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Knowing you there will still BE a disturbance" The pair walk a bit
        before coming across a printing press for The Pennsylvania Evening Post.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Charley, you wait out here. I don't have any currency on me so I will
        have to talk my way into getting a paper"
      </p>
      <p>"We could just ask for the date you know Doctor..."</p>
      <p>
        "Absolutely right Charley! Although I would love to see where in
        American history we are. I know a lot about the beginnings of this
        country but not all the nitty gritty dates"
      </p>
      <p>"We don't even know if this is America yet Doctor!",</p>
      <p>
        "Why of course it is Charley, if I know my geographical smells well
        enough we are in Boston! Now just wait out here. I will only be a
        moment.",
      </p>
      <p>"If I get kidnapped again it is your fault you know"</p>
      <p>
        "Har har, Charley" The Doctor walks into the shop and from the windows 
        on the building's exterior it is easy to tell that the Doctor is getting 
        into a confrontation. Charley however does as the Doctor asked and is 
        waiting outside.
      </p>
      <p>"Hey you, girl" A voice said from behind Charley,</p>
      <p>
        "Me?" Charley said, turning suddenly. In front of her was a tall man with
        messy hair and stubble on his face.
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, you girly. You one of them loyalists?"</p>
      <p>"The what?"</p>
      <p>
        "Don't play dumb with me, you are standing outside of a loyalist
        publication, are you a loyalist?" Before Charley could answer the man
        the door swung open with the Doctor rushing out
      </p>
      <p>
        "You can leave her alone now. We are not loyalist to the British Pigs,
        we just don't happen to be from around here"
      </p>
      <p>"Pompous accent there, y'must be British"</p>
      <p>
        "Like I said, we aren't from around here. Your accent isn't that
        different to begin with. I suggest you leave me and my traveling
        companion alone. We are not on the side of the British army." The man
        turned away and left in a huff.
      </p>
      <p>"British pigs? What is going on Doctor?"</p>
      <p>
        "We have come at a very interesting time Charley. 1778, the American
        Revolution is in full swing, and it just so happens that The
        Pennsylvania Evening Post begins publishing loyalist views, despite it
        being the first english language publication of the Declaration of
        Independence"
      </p>
      <p>"Ok, fine. Now that you know the date can we leave here?"</p>
      <p>
        "Of course not! I've always wanted to meet Thomas Paine, or visit the
        Continental Congress! Come on Charley, we won't have time for both!" The
        Doctor starts running off while Charley just stands there not shocked in
        the slightest.
