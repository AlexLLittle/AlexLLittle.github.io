        “You know what Doctor, that was actually a fun trip!” Charley said to
        the Doctor while entering onto the TARDIS.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I knew that if we walked around a bit we would find something for you
        to do in Philadelphia!”
      </p>
      <p>“Fairmount park was beautiful, and the market had such good fruit!”</p>
      <p>“Don’t forget about seeing a colonial performance of Hamilton!”</p>
      <p>“Shame you had to erase their memories of it”</p>
      <p>
        “Indeed, but the ending does spoil their history, well, most of it does
        not just the ending” The Doctor begins to fiddle with the console and is
        about to take off, “Singapore 1930?”
      </p>
      <p>“Yes Doctor, but first I have something I want to ask you about.”</p>
      <p>
        “What is it Charely? It isn’t about Edith or that fact that you are
        supposed to be dead is it?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “No, of course not! When you were talking to Thomas, you said something
        odd about being a warrior?”
      </p>
      <p>“Oh yes, I suppose I did”</p>
      <p>“What did you mean?”</p>
      <p>
        “Well, as a Timelord I regenerate and my previous face was, mischievous
        to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>“Is that all?”</p>
      <p>
        “Well for now I suppose. My people have many prophecies and one of them
        describes a war to end all wars. I fear it is soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        “How soon?” The Doctor doesn’t answer Charley, pretending not to hear
        her, “Doctor, how soon?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I don’t know!” The Doctor yells, Charley backs up, she had never seen
        him blow up like that before, “I’m sorry Charley. I shouldn’t have
        yelled at you. I just worry about the future. My future” the only noise
        in the room is the TARDIS itself, both of its occupants are dead silent,
        “let's get to Singapore”
      </p>
