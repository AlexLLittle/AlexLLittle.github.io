      <h3>Time of the Revolution</h3>

        “I’m not kidding Charley, this isn’t our fight”
      </p>
      <p>“So are we just going to leave them Doctor?”</p>
      <p>
        “Yes. I don’t want to a hear a word from you chiny” Sarah Jane walks
        toward the 8th Doctor,
      </p>
      <p>“Are you really going to leave?”</p>
      <p>“Yes Sarah”</p>
      <p>
        “Sometimes you disappoint me” She then walks away, back to the future
        incarnation and the two of them run into town chasing after Davros. The
        8th Doctor and Charley continue away from Philadelphia so that they can
        return to their TARDIS in Boston.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the two begin to enter their TARDIS a concerned Charley begins to
        say, “was that the right choice Doctor?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Like I said it wasn’t our fight Charley. He willingly decided to
        endanger countless lives by bringing his TARDIS to me. I can’t stand for
        it so must deal with his own actions himself”
      </p>
      <p>“But what about America? Isn’t preserving history important?”</p>
      <p>
        “It is Charley, but even if that Doctor doesn’t defeat Davros, Davros
        won’t stay long; there is nothing for him on Earth. When the Daleks come
        to rescue him, he will order them back to their war, an uncivilized
        Earth will not help the Daleks against my people.”
      </p>
      <p>“What do you know of this time war?”</p>
      <p>
        “More than I did. My people had my prophecies, one of them being about a
        great war. I never knew much more than it was coming, but today has
        confirmed the worst.”
      </p>
      <p>“And that is?”</p>
      <p>
        “The Daleks are involved. Come Charley, let us get you to Singapore
        1930.”
