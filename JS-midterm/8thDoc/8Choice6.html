        “Now surely you already know this Mr. Paine but your writing is truly
        splendid! It's persuasive, clear and direct. Without your work with
        Common Sense I don’t even think this revolution would have started!” The
        Doctor was in full geek mode, while his tone of voice was the same as
        normal, the speed of which he spoke was much faster. Charley just stood
        there, not particularly shocked at the Doctor's excitement, but
        evidently not wanting to be there.
      </p>
      <p>“You really think so?”</p>
      <p>
        “I do. Now I don’t necessarily agree with every point you made, but it
        is true that Britain under the reign of King George III is tyrannical.”
      </p>
      <p>“Are you a fighter, Doctor?”</p>
      <p>
        “Me? No. I run away from war. I much prefer to travel, and appreciate
        what is, but sometimes,when you are faced with oppression and tyranny,
        there is no other choice.”
      </p>
      <p>“And you agree that Britain is oppressing us?”</p>
      <p>“I do suppose I do”</p>
      <p>“So join our fight!”</p>
      <p>
        “I’m afraid I can’t do that. I’m merely a traveler here to appreciate
        your work”
      </p>
      <p>“If you don’t mind me asking where are you from Doctor?”</p>
      <p>
        “Very far away, Mr. Paine. If you don’t mind I’d like to discuss more of
        your work before you need to leave” The Doctor and Thomas Paine
        continued to talk for what seemed like years for Charley, first starting
        with Paine’s work African Slavery in America condemning the enslavement
        of other humans, before returning to talking about Common Sense.
        Eventually it was time for the newly found friends to separate, “well
        Mr. Paine, this was an insightful discussion about the literary art of
        persuasion and of human ethics, but I imagine you must get going soon”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Very true Doctor, it was a pleasure to talk with someone else so
        insightful, don’t be afraid to drop by again, and do call me Thomas”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Of course my friend. I am sure that this revolution going on will end
        very well for the 13 colonies.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I do hope so Doctor, I really do” As Thomas Paine left Charley walked
        back to the Doctor,
      </p>
      <p>“Can we leave now Doctor?”</p>
      <p>“I’ve never seen you so continuously eager to leave Charley”</p>
      <p>
        “Nothing has happened! I hate being kidnapped and all, but it at least
        gives me something to do”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’m sure I can find something for you to do here in Philadelphia so
        that your time here wasn’t completely wasted if you would like”
      </p>
