        “So Doctor, why won’t we have time for both?” Charley asked as the pair
        were walking.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Time is a fragile thing Charley, if we stay here too long, the chances
        of disturbances to the timeline increases. Both the Congress and Thomas
        Paine will be in Pennsylvania, but we should leave after seeing one of
        them, to lower the odds of us causing issues.”
      </p>
      <p>“So which one are we seeing?”</p>
      <p>
        “I would quite like to meet Thomas Paine, he was an excellent writer you
        know”
      </p>
      <p>“Actually I don’t”</p>
      <p>“What do they teach you?”</p>
      <p>“About the American War of Independence?”</p>
      <p>“I forget that you are British sometimes”</p>
      <p>“Hey!”</p>
      <p>
        “At least I remember that you are human Charley. I could confuse you for
        the vortisaur that we have in the TARDIS” the two of them kept walking
        for a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So how are we getting to Pennsylvania Doctor? Why not take the TARDIS?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “If we take the TARDIS there is a high chance that we will miss our
        destination completely. We will have to take either a boat or carriage.”
      </p>
      <p>“But those could take weeks!”</p>
      <p>
        “That is why once we meet Thomas Paine we will begin the voyage back to
        the TARDIS, now let us make a choice”
