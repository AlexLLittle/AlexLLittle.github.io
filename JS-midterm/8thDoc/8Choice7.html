        “Well then Mr. Paine, I actually do have something I want to ask you” the Doctor started speaking in a slower less animated way, Charley knew that the Doctor was about to dive deep into Paine’s character, “do you think that war is the best way to achieve freedom from the oppression of the British?” as Charley expected the room fell silent, the Doctor standing there with one eyebrow raised.
        </p>
<p>
 “Why, I suppose I see no other way”, Paine eventually said.   
</p>
    <p>
      “And why is that?”   
    </p>
      <p>
       “We tried to persuade the British in other means first-” 
      </p>  
      <p>
       “Like throwing tea off a boat?” Paine was clearly starting to get angry, 
      </p> 
      <p>
        “What do you mean with that? Do you insult us?”
      </p>  
        <p>
            “No no, I merely wonder. A man like you, can you really support the idea of war? You are a good man Thomas, especially for your time with you being against slavery, and wanting a better world without the need of tyranny, but do you believe in this war?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I do Doctor. We the people can not tolerate the oppression of the crown, we must fight for what we believe is right. I believe that our freedom is right. Am I wrong Doctor?”
        </p>
        <p>
        “No but-”    
        </p>
        <p>
          “Sometimes there is no other way. You must understand that Doctor. Are you a warrior yourself?”  
        </p>
        <p>
          “Me a warrior? No. Not this face.”   
        </p>
       <p>
         “I can tell.”
       </p>
       <p>
         “Is that a bad thing?”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Not necessarily Doctor, but I do think we are done here. I have a fight I believe in, just like you must have ones that you don’t. I don’t love the idea of violence but the British give us no other choice” Thomas Paine, turned around and left before the Doctor could say anything else. Charley walked back to the Doctor, 
       </p>
       <p>
         “Can we leave now Doctor? He didn’t seem to like you much.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “It’s not that he didn’t like me, Charley. He is as good of a man as possible for the Eighteenth century, he just believes that war is the only way. I don’t blame him. I’d also hate the leave so soon after taking all this time to get here Charley, I’m sure I can find something for you to do here in Philadelphia so that your time here wasn’t completely wasted if you would like”
