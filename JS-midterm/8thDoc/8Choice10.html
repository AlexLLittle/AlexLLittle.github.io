        “Ah Philadelphia, it's been a while since I’ve been here”
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <p>“So you have been here before Doctor?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, in the year 2104. It hasn’t changed a bit”</p>
      <p>“It’s that bad?”</p>
      <p>
        “It isn’t the greatest place, but it was the birthplace of America so it
        at least has something going on” as the two begin to walk to where the
        Congress Meeting is being held they both hear the familiar sound of the
        TARDIS materializing,
      </p>
      <p>“Doctor is that-”</p>
      <p>
        “Yes, that is the sound of a TARDIS Charley, we need to find where it
        is!” The two begin running till they get to the edge of town and it
        fully materializes,
      </p>
      <p>“That TARDIS is it yours?”</p>
      <p>
        “Yes, and no. It is my TARDIS but it does look different. It must belong
        to a different me”
      </p>
      <p>“A different you?”</p>
      <p>
        “Yes Charley. I am a Timelord, we have this ability to regenerate when
        we die. It changes everything about us, our look, our personality,
        everything except memories.”
      </p>
      <p>“Sounds painful!”</p>
      <p>“Sometimes it is Charley”</p>
      <p>“What are we going to do?”</p>
      <p>
        “Well I can always run up to it and open it, tell whichever me that is
        inside to leave, or let them come out first.
      </p>
