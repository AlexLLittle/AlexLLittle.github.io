        The two travelers eventually decide to go back to the Boston Harbor to fetch a boat ride to Philadelphia, the current residence of Thomas Paine, who is located there due to his role in the Second Continental Congress. The ride is long and the food isnâ€™t very good, but the two of them make it to Philadelphia in perfect health (although Charley is upset to be here at all).</p>
