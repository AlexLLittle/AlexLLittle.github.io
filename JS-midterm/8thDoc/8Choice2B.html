        "Ok Charley, I think I am going to ask that man over there where we are
        and hopefully that will be all we need to know"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Doctor, maybe you should string together a proper sentence before you
        just walk up to someone!" Ignoring Charley entirely the Doctor walks up
        to a random person walking past"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Excuse me sir! When and where are we?" The man looks flabbergasted to
        be asked such a question
      </p>
      <p>
        "Where do you think you are, you idiot?" the man says with a snarl at
        the end. The man was tall with messy hair, stubble unevenly distributed
        across his face
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well based on the smell I got when I first arrived here I'd have to say
        somewhere around the Boston area."
      </p>
      <p>
        "You answered your own question then you fool" The man begins to walk
        off. Charley chuckling to herself
      </p>
      <p>"But wait sir, but WHEN are we?"</p>
      <p>"Excuse me?" the man turns back to face the Doctor.</p>
      <p>
        "I'm pretty sure that you heard me correctly. When are we? What is the
        year, the day, the month even? What is the date sir!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Folks have gone mad these days. It's the fault of the British I tell
        you!" The man says as he begins to walk off. Charley walks up to the
        Doctor still laughing
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well that was fun and all but we learned nothing. Let's go now Doctor"
      </p>
      <p>"No Charley, it wasn't useless. It confirmed my theories!"</p>
      <p>"What theories?"</p>
      <p>
        "Now we know for sure that it is America. This is also a Boston harbor
        and based on the disdain that that man had for the British, this must be
        at least close to the start of the Revolutionary War!
      </p>
      <p>"Great, we might now be in America during a war..."</p>
      <p>
        "Oh knock it off Charley! There is a lot to see in this period of
        American history! If only I could find out the exact date." in the
        distance a young man is running throughout the street yelling. Starting
        inaudible but slowing sounding like an actual language,
      </p>
      <p>
        "John Butler has attacked Forty Fort!" He yells over and over again
        until he eventually goes off into the distance.
      </p>
      <p>"What was that about Doctor?"</p>
      <p>
        It must be July 1778 Charley! Come on if we hurry we can meet Thomas
        Paine, or maybe drop into the Second Continental Congress! We wonâ€™t have
        time for both, let's go!"
      </p>
