        The Doctor and Sarah are sitting there in the dungeon waiting for Davros
        to collect them for further questioning, “brings back memories being
        locked up here in Skaro doesn’t it Sarah?”
      </p>
      <p>“Not pleasant ones”</p>
      <p>“If only Harry were here”</p>
      <p>“I think that is the kindest thing you have ever said about Harry”</p>
      <p>“Nooooo. Maybe.”</p>
      <p>“So what exactly is your plan Doctor?”</p>
      <p>
        “Davros will interrogate us further. From there we can either trick him
        somehow, or fight him directly. Option two will be harder, but more
        effective if it is done right”
      </p>
      <p>“That’s a big if Doctor”</p>
      <p>“It is”</p>
      <p>“What kind of trick?”</p>
      <p>
        “I tell him the wrong information for long enough while you escape the
        room and bring this whole dome crashing down”
      </p>
      <p>“How do I do that?”</p>
      <p>“I have no idea.”</p>
      <p>“So you don’t have a good plan you are saying”</p>
      <p>
        “It is a good plan!” The dungeon doors open and a legion of Daleks is
        there.
      </p>
      <p>“YOU WILL FOLLOW”</p>
      <p>
        “Of course Dalek.” the Doctor says before speaking in a hushed voice,
        “Plan A or Plan B Sarah?
