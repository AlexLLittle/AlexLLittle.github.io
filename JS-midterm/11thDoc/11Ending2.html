        “Well Sarah” the Doctor said while opening the doors to the TARDIS, “I
        feel like that was a successful final voyage for you”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I do suppose it was a fun time being aboard the TARDIS. Please bring me
        to South Croydon, Bannerman Road”
      </p>
      <p>“I will try my best. November 17 2010?”</p>
      <p>“Yes Doctor” the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor opens the door.</p>
      <p>“We will see each other again Sarah, I’m sure of it”</p>
      <p>
        “Goodbye Doctor” the two hug and Sarah leaves the TARDIS, as the TARDIS
        begins to dematerialise Sarah Jane takes in the surroundings, “he
        actually did it. This is Bannerman Road South Croydon, but why are their
        Christmas lights? It must be the wrong month, oh Doctor.”
