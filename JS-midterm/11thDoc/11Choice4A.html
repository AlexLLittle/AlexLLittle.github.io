        “Well Davros” the Doctor started, “right now you do have the upper hand,
        so I’ll ask you nicely to let us go”
      </p>
      <p>“Let you go? Let you go?! Do not think of me as a fool Doctor!”</p>
      <p>
        “I don’t think you are a fool. I know you are-” Sarah elbows him,
        “arent! I know you aren’t a fool, which is why you will let us leave. Us
        two, we aren’t supposed to be here. We are from after the time war, it
        should have been imposs-”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Explain! How can you be alive if the time war is over? The time war
        will not end till all Timelords have been eradicated!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes and no actually, I’m not going to tell you the end of the war, just
        know, that I ended it, now please let us go. We shouldn’t be here and I
        would prefer not to rewrite all of history”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You will not leave Doctor! You will explain to me how the Daleks lost
        the time war!”
      </p>
      <p>“Good going Doctor” Sarah said to him in a whisper.</p>
      <p>
        “All according to plan” The Doctor whispered back, “I will ask you once
        again, let us go. Otherwise it will be a big mistake on your part.”
      </p>
      <p>“My children, throw them into the dungeons!”</p>
      <p>“Ooo you still have dungeons. Now I am excited!”</p>
      <p>“SILENCE! WE WILL TAKE YOU TO THE DUNGEONS”</p>
