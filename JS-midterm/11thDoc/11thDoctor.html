        “Well Sarah Jane, one more trip then I should be taking you home” the
        Doctor said pulling a lever in the TARDIS causing it to dematerialize,
        “I’ll bring you back November 17th 2010, the same day we left”
      </p>
      <p>
        “That would be wonderful” said an older Sarah Jane Smith, no longer the
        same woman that was left in the wrong place by the 4th doctor, “just
        make sure its the correct location”
      </p>
      <p>
        “How many times do I need to apologize for that? Jo never made a fuss
        like that when she was traveling with us”
      </p>
      <p>
        “No she didn’t, but she was right to leave. We are getting too old for
        this”
      </p>
      <p>“Nonsense, I’m thousands of years old and look at me!”</p>
      <p>“Thousands of years old and yet now you have catchphrases…”</p>
      <p>“It’s because bowties are cool. Nobody respects the bowtie”</p>
      <p>
        “Oh Doctor, I am going to miss this. What are you going to do after you
        drop me off?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Amy and Rory still think I’m dead. Probably, so maybe I will drop in
        there, maybe do something else. I don’t know yet.” The TARDIS finally
        landed and the Doctor went to open the doors, outside was a desolate
        wasteland, “come on, lets see whats out here”
      </p>
      <p>“Everything looks so dead Doctor”</p>
      <p>
        “It doesn’t look that bad. Ok maybe it does but I’m sure there will be
        something alive sooner or later”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I have the strangest feeling that I have been here before. I don’t like
        it, maybe we should try somewhere else” The Doctor shrugs off Sarah's
        request and keeps walking. The more he walks the more he agrees with
        Sarah.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ok, maybe we should go, although I am curious. Let's take a rest here
        and I’ll decide in a minute or so.”
