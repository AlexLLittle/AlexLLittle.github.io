        “Ok Sarah, 3, 2, 1, go!” Just like that Davros was pushed outside of the
        TARDIS with his chair spinning wildly. Outside a past incarnation of the
        Doctor and Charley Pollard stand waiting
      </p>
      <p>
        “What the-” The previous incarnation of the Doctor says running towards
        Davros
      </p>
      <p>
        “Not another one of you!” Davros says before the 11th Doctor rushes out
        of the TARDIS to grab Davro’s chair with Sarah behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I was hoping that the TARDIS locked on to a more proactive self than
        you, anyways you know-”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Why if it isn’t Sarah Jane Smith. I can tell it's been a while since
        the last time I saw you, what are you doing traveling with chiny and
        what is going on?” The past incarnation siad.
      </p>
      <p>“Actually I can explain-”</p>
      <p>“Shut up chiny. I trust Sarah to explain much better than you”</p>
      <p>
        “Well, we accidentally landed on Skaro, and after a bit the Doctor
        decided to try and trick Davros onto the TARDIS taking him as far away
        from the time war as possible to save millions of lives”
      </p>
      <p>“The time war?”</p>
      <p>
        “You haven’t gotten there yet” the 11th Doctor interjected, “you will
        soon if we don’t end Davros here and now” Davros begins to squirm around
        in the chair until he gets his hands on the control and spins it, taking
        both Doctors by surprise and starts flying off into town”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Great” the past incarnation of the Doctor started, “now we have let
        Davros loose in revolutionary America”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well what are we going to do Doctor? I’m rather confused on what's
        going on” Charley finally said after standing there watching.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I brought my TARDIS here just so that two of us can be fighting Davros,
        to truly defeat him”
      </p>
      <p>“Is that the best idea Doctor?” Sarah said.</p>
