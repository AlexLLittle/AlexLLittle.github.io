        “Let’s get out of here Sarah!” The Doctor and Sarah run out of the
        TARDIS and are met by a surprised past incarnation of the Doctor and
        Charley Pollard who are standing there, “Ok before either of you speak
        everything will be explained. I was hoping that the TARDIS locked on to
        a more proactive self than you,but that doesn’t matter, what matters is
        that Davros is currently in my TARDIS”
      </p>
      <p>“You let Davros onto our TARDIS?” The past incarnation said?</p>
      <p>“My TARDIS, and yes”</p>
      <p>“Who is Davros? Charley asked her Doctor”</p>
      <p>“I am DAVROS, creator of the Daleks”</p>
      <p>“Davros, we meet again!” The past incarnation said</p>
      <p>
        “Now there are two of you?” the 11th Doctor grabbed onto Davros’ chair
        to prevent him from getting away, and flips multiple of the levers
        again, “not again!”
      </p>
      <p>“He is neutralized, again” the 11th Doctor said.</p>
      <p>
        “Why is that Sarah Jane Smith? I can tell it's been a while since the
        last time I saw you, what are you doing traveling with chiny and what is
        going on?” The past incarnation siad.
      </p>
      <p>“As I was saying-”</p>

      <p>“Shut up chiny. I trust Sarah to explain much better than you”</p>
      <p>
        “Well, we accidentally landed on Skaro, and after a bit the Doctor
        decided to try and trick Davros onto the TARDIS taking him as far away
        from the time war as possible to save millions of lives”
      </p>
      <p>“The time war?”</p>
      <p>
        “You haven’t gotten there yet” the 11th Doctor interjected, “you will
        soon if we don’t end Davros here and now” Davros begins to squirm around
        in the chair until he gets his hands on the control and spins it, taking
        both Doctors by surprise and starts flying off into town”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Great” the past incarnation of the Doctor started, “now we have let
        Davros loose in revolutionary America”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well what are we going to do Doctor? I’m rather confused on what's
        going on” Charley finally said after standing there watching.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I brought my TARDIS here just so that two of us can be fighting Davros,
        to truly defeat him”
      </p>
      <p>“Is that the best idea Doctor?” Sarah said.</p>
