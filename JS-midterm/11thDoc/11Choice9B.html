        “Sarah, I don’t think it matters if we stay in the greenery or not. We should just make a run for the TARDIS. Hopefully they haven’t found it yet but I don’t have high hopes.” the two of them continued to run until eventually they could see a faint object in the distance,
      </p>
      <p>“Doctor look!”</p>
      <p>
        “That must be the TARDIS!” the two began to run towards it but as they
        approached they saw that is was surrounded by Daleks,
      </p>
      <p>“Back away Sarah before they-”</p>
      <p>“YOU WILL WALK TOWARDS THE TARDIS!”</p>
      <p>
        “Nevermind Sarah. Yes you metal blocks, we will walk towards my TARDIS
        and you cannot stop us!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Wise choice Doctor” an old metallic voice said from behind the TARDIS,
      </p>
      <p>“Davros”</p>
      <p>
        “I see that you have regenerated Doctor, I approve of your new face, and
        is that Sarah Jane Smith?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes it is, Doctor what are we going to do?” Sarah asked the Doctor,
      </p>
      <p>“What can we even do Sarah?”</p>
      <p>“You will SURRENDER to me!” Davros declared!</p>
