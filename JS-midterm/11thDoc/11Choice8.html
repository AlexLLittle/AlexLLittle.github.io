        “Sarah, when I say run, RUN!” the two began to run as fast as the could,
        hoping it was towards the TARDIS,
      </p>
      <p>“EXTERMINATE!”</p>
      <p>
        EXTERMINATE!” The Daleks were following behind and constantly shooting.
        Eventually the Doctor and Sarah hit vegetation and the Daleks couldn’t
        directly follow,
      </p>
      <p>“Well Sarah I think that went quite well all things considered”</p>
      <p>“But where are we Doctor?”</p>
      <p>
        “I don’t think we can be that far from the TARDIS, the Daleks will
        hopefully never find us in here so we can-”
      </p>
      <p>
        “EXTERMINATE!” A Dalek snuck up on them so they had to start running yet
        again. While running through all the plant life wasn’t the easiest
        thing, it was still better than the alternative of being exterminated.
        Once they left the vegetation there were no Daleks around, but which way
        was the TARDIS?
