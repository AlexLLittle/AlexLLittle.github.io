        “Well Davros” the Doctor started, “do you really think you can win?”
      </p>
      <p>“Why of course I do Doctor, I have the upper hand”</p>
      <p>
        “You always start with the upper hand Davros, but you never keep it”
      </p>
      <p>“Silence!”</p>
      <p>
        “No. Remember our first time meeting, how you have everything working
        out for you, then your own creatures killed you?”
      </p>
      <p>“I said to be-”</p>
      <p>
        “Or when I tricked you to destroy this very planet we are standing on
        with the hand of Omega? Maybe when-”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Doctor!” Davros yells in his old greasy mechanical voice, “I did not-”
      </p>
      <p>
        “AND I AM TALKING!” The Doctor yells. Maybe when you lose the time war,
        you will see that you never win.
      </p>
      <p>“Explain!”</p>
      <p>
        “Us two, we aren’t supposed to be here. We are from after the time war.
        The Timelord locked Skaro so that we shouldn’t have been able to travel
        here. How could Daleks have won the war if a Timelord is standing right
        in front of you?”
      </p>
      <p>“How could I have lost the time war! Explain to me Doctor!”</p>
      <p>
        “I’m not going to tell you the end of the war, just know that I ended
        it, you don’t have the upper hand, it is for both of our best interests
        if I leave. Then I won’t have to rewrite history by killing you for the
        millionth time”
      </p>
      <p>“Good going Doctor” Sarah said to him in a whisper.</p>
      <p>“All according to plan” The Doctor whispered back.</p>
      <p>
        “I must know how I could have lost! My children, throw them into the
        dungeons!”
      </p>
      <p>“Ooo you still have dungeons. Now I am excited!”</p>
      <p>“SILENCE! WE WILL TAKE YOU TO THE DUNGEONS”</p>
