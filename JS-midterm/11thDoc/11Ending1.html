        After searching around the ruined dome for a while, the Doctor and Sarah
        decide that it is time for them to head back to the TARDIS, “So what do
        you think happened to Davros Doctor?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, he probably got transmatted out of there. Based on the
        surroundings it is clear that they had only recently began rebuilding
        Skaro so this is early in the time war”
      </p>
      <p>“So you don’t think anything changed?”</p>
      <p>
        “I don’t know, Davros knows that he loses now, hopefully it doesn’t
        alter time too much”
      </p>
      <p>“Wouldn’t his death have altered time too?”</p>
      <p>
        “A bit, but the Dalek Emperor would have filled in the gaps of Davros.
        Davros hasn’t been relevant since Skaro was destroyed with the Hand of
        Omega”
      </p>
      <p>“So all of your people would still have died?”</p>
      <p>“Yes”</p>
      <p>“So it would have been for nothing”</p>
      <p>
        “I guess you could say that” the Doctor said while opening the doors to
        the TARDIS, “nonetheless I feel like that was a successful final voyage
        for you”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I do suppose it was a fun time being aboard the TARDIS. Please bring me
        to South Croydon, Bannerman Road”
      </p>
      <p>“I will try my best. November 17 2010?”</p>
      <p>“Yes Doctor” the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor opens the door.</p>
      <p>“We will see each other again Sarah, I’m sure of it”</p>
      <p>
        “Goodbye Doctor” the two hug and Sarah leaves the TARDIS, as the TARDIS
        begins to dematerialise Sarah Jane takes in the surroundings, “he
        actually did it. This is Bannerman Road South Croydon, but why are their
        Christmas lights? It must be the wrong month, oh Doctor.”
