        The Doctor and Sarah are brought down to a low level of the dome and
        into a room with only a table in it, “Leave us” Davros commanded to the
        Daleks.
      </p>
      <p>“Awfully brave of you to get rid of your protection Davros”</p>
      <p>
        “You would not harm me. Outside that door are dozens of Daleks. While
        they are not in here now, it takes one call for you both to be dead”
      </p>
      <p>“Awfully silly to have a table and no chairs”</p>
      <p>“Daleks have no need for a chair”</p>
      <p>“Or a table”</p>
      <p>“Take a seat Doctor”</p>
      <p>“On the floor?”</p>
      <p>“YES”</p>
      <p>
        “Alright, fine. If you are going to sound like a Dalek, I suppose I will
        comply. You too Sarah” both the Doctor and Sarah take a seat on the
        ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Your companion is being awfully silent right now. What are you
        planning, Doctor?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Doctor, I think if I had to pick a favorite album, it would be Abbey
        Road” Sarah Jane said, with particular emphasis on the A of Abbey Road.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You know Davros, I’m not so sure that Sarah needs to be down here with
        us. Why not take her back to the cell”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I will have a Dalek escort her" The Doctor looks at Sarah and subtly
        looks up towards the ceiling, while Davros pushes a button on his chair
        to call in some Daleks, “One of you escort this girl back to the cell.
        Another one of you is staying here. Have all the rest of the Daleks get
        back to work” As Sarah exits the Doctor stands up.
      </p>
      <p>“Why do you stand Doctor?”</p>
      <p>
        “I’m full of energy right now, although I do find it funny that with
        only me in here you added a guard? Do you really think I would hold back
        with Sarah in the room?”
      </p>
      <p>“No but you did make a good point about being defenseless”</p>
      <p>
        “I am full of good points, but you know that already” as the Dalek
        escorts Sarah, most hallways were empty. Sarah assumed from the Doctor
        looking up that a potential self destruct would be towards the top of
        the dome,
      </p>
      <p>
        “Excuse me, Dalek, if you don’t mind I would love to go towards the top
        of the dome, it is made out of glass yes?”
      </p>
      <p>“IT IS MADE OF GLASS”</p>
      <p>“Yes, I’d like to go towards the top for the view”</p>
      <p>“ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS AND I WILL EXTERMINATE YOU”</p>
      <p>
        “Of course, I would never expect otherwise” Meanwhile the Doctor and
        Davros continue to talk, the Doctor continuing to ridicule Davros
        instead telling him anything. When Sarah got to the top, to her
        disappointment, there was nothing she saw that would destroy the whole
        place, but that is when she realized that a Dalek ship could bring the
        whole building down, the only problem is that there were too many Daleks
        here for her to do anything, “excuse me, where do you keep your space
        ships?”
      </p>
      <p>“I CAN NOT SAY”</p>
      <p>
        “Oh well, I suppose you can bring me back to my cell” As Sarah looked
        out the glass she could see that the shuttle craft was still outside and
        that the building was powered from an external generator. If she could
        power on the shuttle and have it move forwards, it would cause the
        generator to explode, meaning she would have to get away from the Dalek
        at ground level. As the Dalek brought her back down she was trying to
        think of ways to lose the Dalek. Blinding it wouldn’t work, she has seen
        that attempted before and the Daleks developed a counter for that. She
        would have to leave it at a corner and hope that she could leave the
        corridor faster than the Dalek could come back around the corner, so
        that is what she did. At a set of corners on the ground level, she ran
        opposite of the Dalek outside of the dome. She could hear Daleks
        beginning to mobilize so she would have to act quickly. She ran to the
        shuttle and went to the cockpit, while she had faced Daleks multiple
        times in the past, she was still terrified of them, from the first time
        she saw them with the Doctor as a young adult, to seeing them less than
        a few years ago on Earth. Due to the shuttle being made to operate by
        Daleks the on switch was easy to find and all she had to do was activate
        it, she pulled out her cellphone had it play music and shoved it into
        the plunger shaped hole, hoping that the vibrations of the phone would
        be enough to turn on the ship, to her delight it was and she ran to the
        back of the shuttle and locked it. That would keep her safe from the
        Daleks and hopefully she would not die on impact. As the shuttle hit the
        generator a giant blast came out killing all the Daleks outside, and
        structurally destroying the building, the Doctor meanwhile was still
        dodging Davro’s questions till the very end,
      </p>
      <p>“What was that noise Doctor?”</p>
      <p>“Why don’t we take a look?”</p>
      <p>“You have tricked me! You sent Sarah to destroy this place!”</p>
      <p>“If that was true would you kill me?”</p>
      <p>“Guard exterminate him!”</p>
      <p>“I'll take that as a yes!”</p>
      <p>
        “EXTERMINATE!” The Doctor ran to the door and hit the open button. He
        ran as fast as he was able to, by the time he got to the exit door he
        was being followed by lots of Daleks. Just as he exited the dome the
        whole thing collapsed crushing all the Daleks. Waiting for him was
        Sarah,
      </p>
      <p>“Doctor!”</p>
      <p>“Sarah you did it! How?”</p>
      <p>
        “I had the shuttle crash into the power generator, do you think Davros
        lived?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hard to tell, I suppose we could stay longer and look for his remains,
        on the off chance he did somehow survive.
