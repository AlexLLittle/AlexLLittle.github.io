        “Yeah you are right Sarah, it isn’t the best idea, let's get out of
        here”

      <p>“Excuse me?” the past incarnation said,</p>
      <p>
        “You heard me. You are the one here, he is now here, it is your problem”
      </p>
      <p>“Doctor!” Sarah said to him,</p>
      <p>“Sarah, I can’t let you get hurt on your last trip lets go”</p>
      <p>
        “No Doctor, I’m staying here, with the other Doctor, if you won’t fight
        Davros, I will”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, goodbye then Sarah Jane Smith” feeling defeated the Doctor walked
        back to his TARDIS before seeing the other Doctor and their two
        companions huddled together thinking of a plan. As he enters the TARDIS
        he flips a few levers and decides to not see Amy and Rory again, at
        least not yet.
