        “Is that all you want Davros?” the Doctor asked, “I can give you so much
        more”
      </p>
      <p>“Doctor?” Sarah asked,</p>
      <p>“What can you give me?”</p>
      <p>
        “Well us two, we shouldn’t be here, we are from after the time war you
        see. You Daleks, you don’t win. I mean I, A TIMELORD, am standing on
        Skaro”
      </p>
      <p>“You will tell me what went wrong!”</p>
      <p>“No”</p>
      <p>“You will or the girl dies!”</p>
      <p>“Doctor!”</p>
      <p>“You think I care when the fate of the universe is at stake?”</p>
      <p>
        “Doctor, do not think of me as a fool. You could have avoided mentioning
        that at all with no threat to your companions life, you know something,
        and you will tell me”
      </p>
      <p>“Nobody wins”</p>
      <p>“You expect me to believe that?”</p>
      <p>
        “Fine. I win. I am the only winner!” The Doctor snaps his fingers
        opening the TARDIS doors and kicks Davros in, “Sarah fast!” The two run
        into the TARDIS and close the doors,
      </p>
      <p>“Doctor, what are you going to do with Davros in the TARDIS?”</p>
      <p>“So this is what your capsule looks like Doctor”</p>
      <p>
        “Shut up Davros!” The Doctor wipes his hand across the computer on
        Davros’ chair, causing DDavros to panic trying to flip everything back,
      </p>
      <p>“What did you do to him, Doctor?”</p>
      <p>
        “Flipped off all his life support, he wont die unless he doesn’t turn it
        back on but it gives us time to talk without worrying about him. I say
        we find another me and use their help to defeat Davros once and for all.
        It won’t change the outcome of the time war I don’t think, but it is
        worth a try! I will use the TARDIS Telepathic Interface to home in on
        myself!”
      </p>
      <p>“Will that work Doctor?”</p>
      <p>
        “Let's find out, GERONIMO!” the Doctor shoves his hands into the
        Telepathic Circuit and the TARDIS takes off, Davros is still flipping
        through all his switches,
      </p>
      <p>“What will we do once we arrive?”</p>
      <p>
        “We need to get out of the TARDIS, we can shove him out, or we can hope
        he will follow us. I will quickly flip some switches so that the TARDIS
        will only respond to me!”
      </p>
