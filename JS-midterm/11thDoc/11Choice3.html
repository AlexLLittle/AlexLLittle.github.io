        “Ok Daleks, I will tell you what you want to hear-”
      </p>
      <p>“WE WANT TO HEAR YOU EXTERMINATED!”</p>
      <p>“Okay, the other thing not that-”</p>
      <p>“WE WANT TO HEAR YOUR COMPANION EXTERMINATED!”</p>
      <p>“No not that either. I mean we surrender. Right Sarah?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, yes! We surrender!”</p>
      <p>“Take us to Davros!”</p>
      <p>
        “FOLLOW US” The Daleks begin to lead the two to a shuttle craft, “GET ON
        THE SHUTTLE AND YOU WILL BE TAKEN TO DAVROS”
      </p>
      <p>“What perfect gentlemen, right Sarah?”</p>
      <p>“I don’t I’d every call a Dalek a gentleman”</p>
      <p>“We really shouldn’t have been able to land here Sarah”</p>
      <p>“What are you going to do Doctor?”</p>
      <p>
        “Meet with Davros I suppose. He won’t listen to me, not truely, so we
        will need to buy time for us to think of an escape”
      </p>
      <p>
        “BE SILENT WE ARE ALMOST TO THE DOME. ONCE WE ARE AT THE DOME DAVROS
        WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU” As the shuttle arrives, the doors open and the
        Daleks bring the Doctor and Sarah to a giant room.
      </p>
      <p>“Ah so you must be Davros”</p>
      <p>
        “Doctor, no need to play the fool. We picked up your TARDIS landing. I
        see you have a new face, and is that Sarah Jane?”
      </p>
      <p>“It is,” Sarah said, staring Davros down.</p>
      <p>
        “With how short human lives are I would have imagined you’d be dead by
        now”
      </p>
      <p>
        “How dare you!” Sarah starts to walk up to Davros before Daleks get in
        the way.
      </p>
      <p>“KEEP AWAY! KEEP AWAY!”</p>
      <p>
        “My children, you have no need to stop her. She is merely a human. The
        Doctor is the one you need to be wary of.”
      </p>
      <p>“I’m flattered”</p>
