        The Doctor and Sarah are brought down to a low level of the dome and
        into a room with only a table in it, “Leave us” Davros commanded to the
        Daleks.
      </p>
      <p>“Awfully brave of you to get rid of your protection Davros”</p>
      <p>
        “You would not harm me. Outside that door are dozens of Daleks. While
        they are not in here now, it takes one call for you both to be dead”
      </p>
      <p>“Awfully silly to have a table and no chairs”</p>
      <p>“Daleks have no need for a chair”</p>
      <p>“Or a table”</p>
      <p>“Take a seat Doctor”</p>
      <p>“On the floor?”</p>
      <p>“YES”</p>
      <p>
        “Alright, fine. If you are going to sound like a Dalek, I suppose I will
        comply. You too Sarah” both the Doctor and Sarah take a seat on the
        ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Your companion is being awfully silent right now. What are you
        planning, Doctor?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Doctor, I think if I had to pick a favorite band, it would be the
        Beatles” Sarah Jane said, with particular emphasis on the B of Beatles.
      </p>
      <p>“Are you ready to talk to our good friend Davros?”</p>
      <p>“Always, Doctor” the two looked at each other,</p>
      <p>
        “Doctor what are you-” the two of them lunged at Davros with the Doctor
        knocking him out of his chair,
      </p>
      <p>
        “Sarah we need to go! We need to take this whole place down!” Sarah hit
        the button to open the door and the two of them ran out with Daleks
        beginning to follow, “Sarah, I might have thought of an idea. The
        shuttle we took here can probably be used to take this whole place down”
      </p>
      <p>“Really?”</p>
      <p>
        “I can probably activate it with my sonic screwdriver, the only problem
        would be it not causing enough damage to this whole place” the two kept
        running till they both got outside. Once they got outside they began
        looking for the shuttle,
      </p>
      <p>
        “There Doctor!” Sarah said pointing at it, “to our left!” the pair ran
        to it, once at it Sarah immediately closed the doors and the Doctor ran
        to the front,
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ok so it looks like if we go forward we will hit the power generator.
        The problem is we are surrounded by Daleks so we cannot leave, and their
        is no guarantee that will will survive the impact”
      </p>
      <p>“So we die either way?”</p>
      <p>“Possibly?”</p>
      <p>
        “I’d rather die in the explosion of a power generator than through
        extermination”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Anyways” the Doctor started as he pulled out his sonic screwdriver,
        “GERONIMO!” the shuttle sped forward until it hit the generator and
        everything went black. When they both opened their eyes all the Daleks
        on the outside of the dome were frozen and the dome itself appeared to
        have collapsed, “that was rather easy and anticlimactic”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Do you think Davros is dead? What about the other Daleks?” They walked
        out of the shuttle and the Daleks didn’t move at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The Daleks are dead. Hard to say Davros is alive, but he always could have
        escaped. I suppose we could stay longer and look for his remains, on the
        off chance he did somehow survive.
      </p>

        <strong>Should the Doctor Stay to Look for the Body of Davros?</strong>
