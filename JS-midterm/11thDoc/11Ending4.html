        “It may not be the greatest idea Sarah, but with the amount of brain
        power we have here it will work!” the 11th Doctor reassured Sarah,
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ok chiny, Charley and I will head to the right to track down Davros,
        you and Sarah head to the left. We want to corner him by the Liberty
        Bell -”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, that is because the frequency of the bell will most likely be
        perfect for disabling his chair, trapping him there!”
      </p>
      <p>“Will that actually work Doctor?” Charley asked,</p>
      <p>“Yes Charley, it will” the past Doctor said back to her,</p>
      <p>
        “It seems awfully simple Doctors, after all that I’ve seen Davros do,
        can a bell really stop him?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I know it sounds stupid” the 11th Doctor began to say, “but trust us
        Sarah. I know first hand you have seen the pain that Davros has caused
        and there is no way I will let him get away with it any longer, do you
        agree Doctor?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I do. Everytime I think I have defeated Davros for good, I always see
        him again, but no more. If this time war you speak of is the one from
        the prophecies I cannot let it happen”
      </p>
      <p>“The end of the Timelords”</p>
      <p>“I won’t let it happen”</p>
      <p>“Good”</p>
      <p>
        “We should probably go!” Charley said tugging on the past Doctors
        jacket, “I hear screaming in town!” The two groups split off. Sarah and
        the Doctor took a few wrong turns but they eventually found that the
        past Doctor was already confronting Davros at the liberty bell
      </p>
      <p>“Your people will all die” Davros told the past Doctor</p>
      <p>“I doubt that” the past Doctor said in retort</p>
      <p>
        “It's true” the 11th Doctor says, arriving with Sarah Jane, “to end the
        war, there was only one way”
      </p>
      <p>“What are you saying” the past Doctor asks</p>
      <p>“I… We end it all. Timelord and Daleks”</p>
      <p>
        “No, that isn’t-” Davros begins to let out a disgusting chuckle, a
        mechanical sound akin to a cars engine, as the past Doctor begins to
        open his mouth to respond the 11th Doctor rings the bell causing Davros
        to shake in silence,
      </p>
      <p>“Doctor, what is that in the sky?” Chaley asks looking right up,</p>
      <p>
        “The Daleks are here for him, '' Sarah says as Davros is transmatted
        aboard the ship.
      </p>
      <p>“We failed” the two Doctors said looking at each other</p>
      <p>“What will happen to America?”</p>
      <p>“Nothing will Sarah” the Doctor says.</p>
      <p>
        “Chiny is right, the Daleks have no use for an uncivilized planet right
        now, they only need their chief. If Davros ordered invasion, they would
        do it, but he wont.” The two Doctors decide their is nothing more to do
        and they head back to the future incarnations TARDIS,
      </p>
      <p>“Need a lift to your TARDIS?”</p>
      <p>
        “That would be great chiny, but I really hate the redecoration in here”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Shut it, I’m the one giving you a ride” The past Doctor walks towards
        Sarah,
      </p>
      <p>“How long has it been for you”</p>
      <p>
        “Ages Doctor, ages, but I did get you a few times before getting back on
        the TARDIS”
      </p>
      <p>“You didn’t get back on right away?”</p>
      <p>
        “I couldn’t, this isn’t all that is in my life now, after offering a few
        times though I decided to take up the Doctors offer of traveling again.
        Hopefully your future self will drop me off in the right place this
        time!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Sorry to break up the reunion,” the 11th Doctor said, “but we are here
        in Boston”
      </p>
      <p>“Thanks for the lift chiny!”</p>
      <p>
        “Get out” the future incarnation shoved the past Doctor and Charley out.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Is that the right spot for them?” Sarah said as the Doctor began
        messing with the console again,
      </p>
      <p>
        “Location is right, I never did check the date, either way their TARDIS
        was there. November 17th right?”
      </p>
      <p>“Yes Doctor” the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor opens the door.</p>
      <p>“We will see each other again Sarah, I’m sure of it”</p>
      <p>
        “Goodbye Doctor” the two hug and Sarah leaves the TARDIS, as the TARDIS
        begins to dematerialise Sarah Jane takes in the surroundings, “he
        actually did it. This is Bannerman Road South Croydon, but why are their
        Christmas lights? It must be the wrong month, oh Doctor.”
