        “Sarah, I think you are right and that we should head back to the TARDIS.”
      </p>
      <p>“Great, I’m glad you think so, but which way is the TARDIS?”</p>
      <p>
        “I have no idea” The two of them began to walk in the direction they thought the TARDIS was in, while they were getting closer to the TARDIS than they were before, they were still going the wrong direction and they eventually reached a cliff.
      </p>
      <p>“Look Doctor, a cliff!”</p>
      <p>
        ”Yes, and some light vegetation too. This feels extremely familiar. In
        fact I am positive I was here a very long time ago, but when?” As they
        approach the edge, down below is a giant city made mostly of domes,
        “Sarah, we need to run, faster than we ever have before”
      </p>
      <p>“What's wrong Doctor? Why I don’t recognize that city at all”</p>
      <p>“You have only been to Skaro once, before the Daleks took it over.”</p>
      <p>“Did you say Skaro?”</p>
      <p>
        “We shouldn’t be here. The Timelord put a time lock on Skaro, how are we
        here?” Suddenly Daleks start hovering from the cliff and surround the
        Doctor and Sarah,
      </p>
      <p>“THE DOCTOR HAS BEEN LOCATED”</p>
      <p>“WE MUST BRING HIM TO DAVROS”</p>
      <p>“DAVROS WILL SPEAK WITH YOU”</p>
