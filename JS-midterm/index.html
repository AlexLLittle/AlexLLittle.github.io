        <p class="StoryText" id="StoryText">Welcome to my Doctor Who choose your own adventure story! 
            Every page will a chunk of text that advances the main story, and buttons that you can 
            click to change the outcome of the story with! Some choices will be smaller and the story 
            will reconverge either way, but some choices can cause you to have a different ending or a 
            completely different story! The first choice that you will have to make today is which doctor 
            you want to see the travels of, with each Doctor having a unique substory. Your first choice is the 8th Doctor, tall, handsome and an admirer 
            of the arts, who is traveling with Charley Pollard. Your other choice is the 11th Doctor, childlike, 
            full of energy, and known as the incarnation that "forgets", who is traveling with veteran companion 
            Sarah Jane Smith. The Choice is yours.</p>
