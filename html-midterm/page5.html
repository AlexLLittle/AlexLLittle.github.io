    <h1>What Alex fixed</h1>
    <h2>Page 1 errors</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Line 1, no !DOCTYPE html: I added that in.</li>
      <li>
        Line 80, closing em tag was not completed: fixed the em closing tag to
        read "/em" and not "e"
      </li>
      <li>
        Line 32, H2 after H3 tag: fixed by switching the H2 and H3 tags around
      </li>
      <li>
        Line 81, p tag has unclosed elements: fixed with issue 2 in line 80.
        That was the open tag.
      </li>
      <li>Added language data</li>
    </ol>
    <p>No errors shown in w3 Validator</p>
    <h2>Page 2 errors</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Line 27, inclomplete b tag: fixed the closing tag by filling the empty
        tag with /b
      </li>
      <li>
        Line 53, had the b tag inheriting the h2 tag instead of the other way
        around: I fixed by putting the b tag inside the h2 tag
      </li>
      <li>
        Line 74, unlike all the other headers line 76 used the h6 with no b tag,
        "interior" is also bigger than all other headers besides the h1: I fixed
        this inconsistency and made the headers with a line under them h2, and
        the headers inbetween paragraphs h3
      </li>
      <li>
        Line 57, spaces are not allowed in links and the link contained spaces:
        I fixed this by removing the spaces in the link.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Page 3 errors</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Line 53, the list tag was put in wrong, just as l, not li: fixed by
        correcting the incorrect tag
      </li>
      <li>
        Line 82, the closing tag of that part of the table was missing its
        contents: Fixed by added the td to the closing tag completing it
      </li>
      <li>
        Line 98, one of the table columns was outside of the tr tag: Fixed by
        moving the td emelent a few lines down inside of the tr tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Table, the placement of the td elements within the tr elements was
        messed up casuing some rows to have more columns that others and the
        data to be hard to read: This was fixed by making sure all rows had
        three sets of data (first name, last name, age) and nothing else. Also
        in addition the name Zapata used the table header tag instead of the
        table column tag causing it to look wrong. That was fixed too.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Page 4 errors</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Line 1, no !DOCTYPE html: I added that in.</li>
      <li>
        Throughout, none of the images had alts: I went in and added alts to
        every image
      </li>
      <li>
        The pictures were all in the wrong place in the table: I just moved
        around the images to the correct grouping to fix this
      </li>
      <li>
        Two of the images were missing the td tag meaning there were not in the
        table: Fixed by adding the tag so they appear in the table.
      </li>
    </ol>
