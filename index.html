        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hello, I am Alex Little. I am a second year student at the Univeristy
          of Colorado Boulder. My major is Creative Technology and Design with a
          focus on Film, which also happens to be my minor. I decided at a young
          age that I liked movies so much, that I wanted to join in the fun and
          make them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides movies there are plenty of other things I enjoy including
          video games(particularily stragety games), Doctor Who, music,
          Photoshop, and writing.
        </p>

      <h3 id="Nav2">My Photoshop Work</h3>
      <p>
        Earlier I mentioned that I quite enjoy photoshop. Recently to help me
        keep getting better at photoshop I have started to plaster myself over
        famous album artwork. This is what I have made so far.

      <h3 id="Nav3">My Film Work</h3>
      <p>
        Since I want to be a filmmaker I have made some short films! Some for
        school, some for fun.

          A radio show that I wrote and directed for a final in the Fall
          Semester of my senior year of high school

          Another radio show I wrote and directed, not part of school this time.
          I had 5 episodes writen, but do to actor commitments, episodes 2-5
          were never made.

          A video sequel to a video I had made around when I was 10 years old. I
          classify this video as a "shitpost".

        <p>
          Another "shitpost", this time in the form of a Minecraft video. I
          honestly still enjoy this one a lot.

          My first project in CINE 2010 where we had to make a super cut out of
          found footage. This uses logos of film comapnies to show an evolution
          of how logos have changed overtime.

          First proper project in CINE 2000. We had to make a homage to randomly
          generated film. Mine was a French documentary about some musician. It
          was mostly indoors, that and the name was where my "homage" came in. I
          for fun decided to make the "worst" film ever from a technical
          standpoint.

        <p>
          For my second CINE 2010 project we were given a bunch of takes of a
          seen and to edit a continuity cut. I focused on the emotional
          continuity of the guy in the desk.

        <p>
          For my next CINE 2000 project we had to make a structural film. The
          main idea of mine came from "Nostalgia" by Holis Frampton. In this
          film I restring one of my guitars.

        <p>
          For the midterm project in CINE 2010 we had to make a genre shifted
          trailer. I choose to do Scott Pilgrim in the style of a Bond Film. I
          actually quite proud of this edit still.

        <p>
          For the penultimate project in CINE 2000 we had to make a self
          portrait. I honestly don't remember the making of this one.
        </p>

        <p>Right before the final in CINE 2010 we had a mini project where we got to play with audio and color grading. These were also shown at the final where mine was deemed the "winner". This is blocked on YouTube too. I have no clue if it will play for anyone but me.</p> -->

          My final for CINE 2000 where we had to make an experiemental
          narrative. I did this through landscapes, long shots, and long takes.
          This is my favorite thing I've ever made. I'm very proud of it.

          My CINE 2010 final was a personal documentary. Turned out pretty good
          in the end.
